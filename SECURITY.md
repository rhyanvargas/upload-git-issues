# 🛡️ Security Documentation

## Security Overview

The `upload-git-issues` CLI tool is designed with security as a top priority. This document outlines all security measures implemented to protect users' data and systems.

## 🔒 Security Guarantees

### ✅ **File System Security**
- **Read-Only Access**: Only reads CSV files, never writes or deletes files
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents `../` attacks and directory traversal
- **File Type Validation**: Only accepts `.csv` files
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size of 50MB to prevent DoS attacks
- **No System Access**: Cannot access system directories or sensitive files

### ✅ **Network Security**
- **HTTPS Only**: All network requests use HTTPS encryption
- **Domain Whitelist**: Only connects to `api.github.com` and `github.com`
- **No Arbitrary Requests**: Cannot make requests to unauthorized domains
- **Request Logging**: All network activity is logged (without sensitive data)

### ✅ **Data Handling Security**
- **Token Validation**: GitHub tokens are validated before use
- **No Token Storage**: Tokens are never saved to disk or cached
- **Data Sanitization**: All CSV input is sanitized to prevent injection
- **Sensitive Data Masking**: Tokens and sensitive data are masked in logs
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### ✅ **Dependency Security**
- **Trusted Packages Only**: Uses only well-known, trusted npm packages
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keeps dependency footprint small
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated for security patches
- **No Malicious Code**: All dependencies are audited for security

## 🔍 Security Audit

### Automated Security Checks

Run the built-in security audit:

```bash
npm run security-audit
```

This performs:
- Source code analysis for dangerous patterns
- Dependency security verification
- Network request validation
- Security feature verification

### Manual Verification

Users can verify security by:

1. **Reviewing Source Code**: All source code is available on GitHub
2. **Checking Dependencies**: Review `package.json` for trusted packages only
3. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network requests (only to GitHub)
4. **File System Monitoring**: Verify only CSV file reads occur

## 🚨 What This Tool CANNOT Do

To ensure transparency, here's what the tool **cannot** and **will not** do:

### ❌ **File System**
- Cannot write files to your system
- Cannot delete or modify existing files
- Cannot access files outside the specified CSV
- Cannot access system directories (`/etc`, `/usr`, etc.)
- Cannot execute other programs or scripts

### ❌ **Network**
- Cannot connect to arbitrary websites
- Cannot send data to unauthorized servers
- Cannot perform DNS lookups for malicious domains
- Cannot download or upload files (except GitHub API calls)

### ❌ **Data**
- Cannot store your GitHub token permanently
- Cannot log sensitive information
- Cannot send your data to third parties
- Cannot access environment variables or system secrets

## 🔐 Security Features in Detail

### 1. File Path Validation

```typescript
// Example: Safe file path validation
const validation = validateSafeFilePath(filePath);
if (!validation.safe) {
  throw new Error(`Security validation failed: ${validation.reason}`);
}
```

**Protects Against:**
- Path traversal attacks (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- Access to system files
- Large file DoS attacks
- Non-CSV file processing

### 2. GitHub Token Security

```typescript
// Example: Token sanitization
const validation = sanitizeGitHubToken(token);
if (!validation.valid) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid token: ${validation.reason}`);
}
```

**Protects Against:**
- Invalid token formats
- Token injection attacks
- Accidental token logging
- Token persistence

### 3. CSV Injection Protection

```typescript
// Example: CSV data sanitization
const sanitizedData = sanitizeCsvData(rawData);
```

**Protects Against:**
- Formula injection (`=cmd|'/c calc'!A0`)
- Script injection in CSV cells
- Malicious CSV payloads

### 4. Network Request Validation

```typescript
// Example: Network security
const validation = validateNetworkRequest(url);
if (!validation.allowed) {
  throw new Error(`Unauthorized request: ${validation.reason}`);
}
```

**Protects Against:**
- Requests to malicious domains
- Data exfiltration attempts
- SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
- Man-in-the-middle attacks (HTTPS only)

## 🛠️ Security Testing

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Test with verbose security logging
npm run dev example.csv --dry-run --verbose

# Test file validation
npm run test-parser example.csv
```

### Security Test Cases

The tool includes tests for:
- ✅ Valid CSV files are accepted
- ✅ Invalid file types are rejected
- ✅ Path traversal attempts are blocked
- ✅ Large files are rejected
- ✅ Invalid tokens are rejected
- ✅ CSV injection is prevented
- ✅ Network requests are validated

## 📊 Security Audit Results

Latest security audit results:

```
🔍 Source Code Security Audit

## 🚨 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-email]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow 48 hours for initial response
